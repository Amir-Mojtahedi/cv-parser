## TODO: Authentication & User Management

### High Priority (Critical Issues)
1. **Fix account creation flow** - Don't show "failed to create account" when it actually succeeded and redirect users to dashboard after successful account creation
2. **Enable Google OAuth** - Implement Google authentication as an alternative login method
3. **Add logout functionality** - Implement a sign-out button for users to log out of their accounts
4. **Password security** - Hash passwords using a library that works in an edge environment (e.g., bcryptjs or similar)

### Medium Priority (Core Features)
5. **CV management** - Enable users to download CVs and implement browser preview functionality
6. **CV parser support** - Ensure CV parser accepts multiple formats: PDF, DOCX, JPEG, JPG, and PNG
7. **Personalized matching** - Enable personalized weights for clients based on specific job requirements
8. **Data storage optimization** - Review and optimize what data needs to be stored in Redis beyond matched CVs

### Low Priority (Code Quality)
9. **Code refactoring** - Improve code structure, remove duplication, and enhance maintainability
10. **Performance optimization** - Optimize application performance, reduce load times, and improve user experience
